# Cosnap AI - User Onboarding Strategy & Implementation

## Current Onboarding Analysis

### Existing Onboarding Flow
- **Registration**: Email/username registration with verification ✅
- **First Experience**: Direct to home page with effect carousel ⚠️
- **Feature Discovery**: No guided tour or introduction ❌

### User Journey Pain Points
1. **Overwhelming Interface**: Too many options without guidance
2. **Complex AI Concepts**: Technical jargon (ComfyUI, workflows) intimidates users
3. **No Clear Next Steps**: Users don't know what to try first
4. **Missing Context**: Effects lack clear use case explanations
5. **No Progress Tracking**: No sense of achievement or learning progression

## Strategic Onboarding Approach

### Core Principles
