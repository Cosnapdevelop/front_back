2. **Quality Compromise**: Focus on core functionality reduces complexity
3. **Launch Delays**: Simplified scope increases success probability

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Daily Progress Reviews**: Catch issues early
2. **Feature Flexibility**: Ready to defer non-critical items
3. **Quality Gates**: No feature ships without testing
4. **Scope Protection**: Resist adding new features during sprint

- **Timeline**: 14 days
- **Success Probability**: 15%
- **Risk**: High - likely 2-3 week delay

#### **Revised Plan (Realistic)**
- **Features**: 3-4 core SEO components, basic error handling, essential UX
- **Timeline**: 14 days
- **Success Probability**: 85%
- **Risk**: Low - achievable with buffer time

### Implementation Quality Standards

#### **Non-Negotiable Requirements**
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Security audit passed
- Performance targets met
- Mobile responsiveness working
- Core user journey functional

#### **Flexible Requirements**
- Advanced error recovery (basic error handling sufficient)
- Complex SEO features (basic meta tags sufficient)
- Comprehensive analytics (basic tracking sufficient)
- Advanced UX animations (simple interactions sufficient)

### Success Indicators

#### **Green Lights (Go for Launch)**
- All critical bugs fixed and tested
- Core user journey works end-to-end
- Security audit passed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Beta user feedback positive

#### **Red Lights (Do Not Launch)**
