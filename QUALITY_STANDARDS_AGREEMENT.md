# Quality Standards Agreement - Week 3-4 Execution
## Non-Negotiable Quality Criteria for Production Launch

**Document Type**: Quality Assurance Framework  
**Urgency**: CRITICAL - Quality Gates for Launch Readiness  
**Timeline**: Week 3-4 Execution (Days 1-14)  
**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Authority**: Product Manager - Final quality gate decisions

## QUALITY FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### **Quality Philosophy**
**Quality over Speed**: While timeline is critical, compromising on these quality standards will result in launch delays and user experience failures. These standards represent the **minimum viable quality** for production launch.

### **Non-Negotiable Principle**
These quality standards are **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Any failure to meet these criteria will trigger:
1. **Immediate work stoppage** on affected components
2. **Required remediation** before proceeding
3. **Product Manager review** and go/no-go decision
4. **Potential scope adjustment** to maintain quality

### **Quality Gate Authority**
- **Product Manager**: Final authority on quality gate pass/fail decisions
- **Team Members**: Responsible for self-assessment and honest reporting
- **Escalation**: Immediate escalation required for any quality concerns
